\chapter{Outline}

Intro: Overview of fireballs, why they're important to research, etc...

Background: 3-4 parts in it, explaining what a fireball is and covering how they're detected, include different methods found from papers, method using D6. Also talk about PJ's and Luke's previous work on getting the code set up for analysis.

Analysis and Detection: Talk about how fireballs are detected and analyzed by D6, and then how the images captured are analyzed to weed out any false positives, and how the total are observed by D6 is calculated. Discuss code worked on in the fall and spring to streamline these processes.

Data: Talk about data collected over the year, it's implications, what it means, etc... what went wrong and what went right in terms of data collection.

Conclusion/Next Steps: Give any conclusions from the data, is D6 an effective way/accurate way of detecting fireballs compared to other established methods, talk about what next steps could look like, directions the code could take, what could also be useful, modeling, another camera, etc...
