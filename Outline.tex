\chapter{Outline}

Intro: Overview of fireballs, why they're important to research, what the research is focused on.

Background: 

-Subsection covering what fireballs are

-Subsection covering the ways fireballs are detected, showcasing CAMS, D6, SPMN, each being a subsection with a brief blurb at the beginning dicussing in broad terms how fireballs are detected.

-Subsection covering what previous work has been done on the project, with subsections for Luke's photometry, the beginning steps that Kyle took, and PJ's forray into determining the total area that is covered by the camera.

-Subsection discussing Flux and how it is calculated

Analysis and Detection: Talk about how fireballs are detected and analyzed by D6, and then how the images captured are analyzed to weed out any false positives, and how the total area observed by D6 is calculated and used to only have the fireball light for luminosity analysis. Discuss code worked on in the fall and spring to streamline these processes.

Data: Talk about data collected over the year, it's implications, what it means, etc... what went wrong and what went right in terms of data collection.

Conclusion/Next Steps: Give any conclusions from the data, is D6 an effective way/accurate way of detecting fireballs compared to other established methods, talk about what next steps could look like, directions the code could take, what could also be useful, modeling, another camera, etc...
